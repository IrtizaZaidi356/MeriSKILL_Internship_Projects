### Project 1: Sales Data Analysis | Remote Internship | MeriSKILL

This Power BI Sales Data Analysis üìä project equips you with the skills and tools necessary to extract valuable insights from large datasets. By analyzing sales trends, identifying top-selling products, and calculating revenue metrics, you empower your organization to make informed, data-driven decisions. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore the data, while the provided recommendations offer clear guidance for optimizing sales strategies. In essence, this project demonstrates your proficiency in data manipulation and analysis, contributing to more effective business decisions and strategies.üìä

#### **Data Import and Transformation:** 
 - We start by importing and transforming the sales data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

#### **Sales Trends Analysis:** 
 - Utilizing Power BI's rich visualization capabilities, we delve into sales trends over time. This phase uncovers seasonality, growth patterns, and areas for potential improvement.

#### **Top-Selling Products Identification:** 
 - We determine the best-selling products, shedding light on which items are driving the most revenue, which can inform inventory management and marketing strategies.

#### **Revenue Metrics Calculation:** 
 - We calculate pivotal revenue metrics, including total sales and profit margins, to understand the financial performance of the business.

#### **Data Visualization:** 
 - A key strength of Power BI is its ability to create compelling data visualizations. We harness this to present our findings in an understandable and engaging manner.

#### **Data-Driven Recommendations:** 
 - Based on the insights derived from the analysis, we provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies. These recommendations are grounded in the data, making them highly actionable.

#### **Interactive Dashboard Creation:** 
 - Central to our project is the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and comprehending the primary insights.

## **Title Project No# 02: Diabetes Patients**
### **Problem Statement | Project No# 02: Diabetes Patients**

- This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
- The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on
certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the
selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
- From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

### **Project No 2: Title: Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indian Patients using Python**
- The "Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indian Patients" project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of diabetes in Pima Indian female patients who are at least 21 years old. This model uses diagnostic measurements to provide personalized predictions and assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
 - The project begins with an EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics and distribution. Visualizations, including histograms and scatterplots, offer insights into the distribution of variables like age, pregnancies, glucose, and insulin. The EDA also includes a correlation matrix heatmap to reveal relationships between variables.

#### **Data Preprocessing:** 
 - Feature scaling is applied to normalize the dataset, and the data is divided into training and testing sets. The choice of a Random Forest Classifier as the predictive model ensures
robustness and reliability.

#### **Machine Learning Model:**
 - The Random Forest Classifier is employed to predict diabetes. This ensemble learning technique excels in handling complex datasets, making it an excellent choice for this medical
prediction task. The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

#### **User Interaction:** 
 - One of the project's highlights is its interactive nature. A function is developed to allow users to input their medical predictor variables. The model then generates personalized predictions regarding the likelihood of diabetes. This interactive feature makes the project a valuable tool for personalized healthcare decision-making.

#### **Python Libraries:**
 - Throughout the project, various Python libraries are utilized, including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries streamline data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning model development, making the code accessible and adaptable for broader healthcare applications.

#### **Summary:**
In summary, the **"Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indian Patients" Project** is a compelling example of how data science and machine learning can be applied to address healthcare challenges. By leveraging diagnostic measurements, this project aids in the early detection of diabetes and empowers individuals with personalized risk assessments. It serves as a model for utilizing data-driven approaches to improve public health, particularly in populations with specific healthcare needs.
